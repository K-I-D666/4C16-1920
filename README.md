# 4C16 (2019/2020)

4C16/5C16 is course on Machine Learning (ML), with a focus on
Deep Learning. It is a fourth and fifth year module offered by the [Electronic &
Electrical Engineering](https://www.tcd.ie/eleceng/) department to the
undergraduate students of [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie).

Although Deep Learning has been around for quite a while, it has recently become
a disruptive technology that has been unexpectedly taking over operations of
technology companies around the world and disrupting all aspects of
society. When you read or hear about AI or machine Learning successes in the
news, it really means Deep Learning successes.

The course starts with an introduction to some essential aspects of Machine
Learning, including Least Squares, Logistic Regression and a quick overview of
some popular classification techniques.

Then the course dives into the fundamentals of Neural Nets, including
Feed Forward Neural Nets, Convolution Neural Nets and Recurrent Neural
Nets.

The material is constructed in collaboration with leading industrial
practitioners including Google, YouTube and Movidius, and students will have
guest lectures from these companies.


## Labs

We have designed a unique environment specifically for this course so
that students can learn best industry practices.

Our web platform can transparently connect students to a Google Cloud
Platform cluster via web based terminal/editor/Jupyter sessions. Labs
use the Keras framework and are automatically assessed using Git to
give immediate feedback.

Labs include designing and training various DNN for image
classification challenges, self driving car (simulator) and text
processing.

# Handouts

handouts and videos from last years an be found [here (2017/18)](https://github.com/frcs/4C16-2017) and [here (2018/19)](https://github.com/frcs/4C16). This year the lectures will not be recorded.

## labs

It is recommended to students to refresh their knowledge of Python 3
prior to starting 4C16. Some useful resources are listed in the
document below:
